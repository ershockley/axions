# axions

On midway, use the `stats` environment so you have access to blueice, laidbax, etc.

```
source activate stats

# run your notebook, script, etc
```

The ALPlimit notebook should be a mostly working example. Right now there's a lot hardcoded so you likely have to make changes in the notebook and Axion.py for data locations, paths to save files, etc. Hopefully this is very temporary.
